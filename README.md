# AirHockey

Air hockey game and strategy simulation.

## Dependencies:

-   pygame (pip install pygame)

## Control:

-   Left mouse button - control right striker

-   Middle mouse button - puck will move to mouse position instantly

-   Right mouse button - puck will follow mouse (debug, strategy analysis etc.)

-   Mouse scroll - Change speed of the game

## Note:

Both strikers should now exhibit more advanced playstyle. Prediction and aiming are now implemented. 2 different strategies play againt each other. This should be almost final version of hardcoded strategies. Next step is to try teaching NN to play (NEAT, neuroevultion etc).
